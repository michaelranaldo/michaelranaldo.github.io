This is the repository for my GitHub pages site.

As with every site, I will probably pay an awful lot of attention to this once every year or so before forgetting to update. When I do update it will most likely be a blog post promising to update more frequently. Since no one would really care whether I did or did not, this will obviously not be a binding promise and I can go back to more urgent matters. Like counting the number of bricks on the side of my house or wondering if my SSL certificates are valid.
