# Michael Ranaldo: The Source of the Blog

This is the source of my site and / or blog.

It's exactly the same as the site but with a (hopefully) worse user experience. If you find this is not the case, please let me know and I will change the site's theme to something more readable.

----

If you have any issues, comments, critique, or just have a burning desire to publicly let me know something (about the site), feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelranaldo/michaelranaldo.github.io) and/or spam my email at [blog@ranaldo.co.uk](mailto:blog@ranaldo.co.uk).
